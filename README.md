COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course is a comprehensive study of SQL and TSQL using the SQL Server relational database management system. You will have hands-on training that will include the use of TSQL, SQL Server Management Studio, database creation, CLR, data queries, view definitions and use operators and functions, triggers, calculations, indexing, cursors and data manipulation.

COURSE OBJECTIVES/LEARNER OUTCOMES

Upon successful completion of this course the student should be able to:

1.	Identify and utilize database design methodologies
2.	Use and describe database connectivity, database-performance tuning, and data mining methodologies
3.	Describe distributed database management systems and their components
4.	Describe high level concepts of utilization and data migration, data warehousing and online analytical processing (OLAP) methodologies
5.	Identify and maintain databases with concurrency control, recovery management, account management and security
6.	Identify and describe data modeling techniques

COURSE STRUCTURE

This course is presented as a series of 10 modules over the course of eleven weeks. These will include lectures, assignment/lab, term project, quizzes, and exams. The reading materials along with the course deliverables will be described in each module.

The quizzes and exams will cover textbook and lecture material. There will be weekly labs and activities based off of the readings required from each module. In place of having a final exam to show a comprehensive understanding of the learning objectives and course material that was covered over the entire term the term project will be used to measure your understanding and competencies. 

The lectures will be given online asynchronously with the support of video lectures and resources that can be found on Canvas. There will be an online Zoom meetup session once per week for Q and A. 


STUDENT RESPONSIBILITY 

Class Participation: Students are expected to manage their time to be able to complete the course curriculum activities. This includes, turning in all assignments and accomplish all of the quizzes and exams by the assigned due date. 

Grade Disputes: If you wish to dispute the grade assigned to a paper, presentation, or a question on an exam, you must do so in writing. 

Distance Learning Etiquette

When class is being presented in Zoom you are expected to attend on time and fully participate as if you were physically present in class. It may be tempting to search the internet or catch up on other activities while in class, but this will decrease your chance of successfully completing this course. 

Keep your microphone muted unless you are speaking to the group. Consider using headphones/earbuds with a mic as this will reduce feedback and background noise. It is not appropriate to join class from your bed, while lying on the couch, walking around, or driving down the road. If your video behavior is disruptive to the class, I will provide you with a prompt to change your behavior. If you cannot, I will eject you from the Zoom meeting in order to ensure that the other students are not disrupted by your actions.

GRADING SYSTEM

Each component will contribute to the following proportion: 

Item                                                 Points                        
	
Lab 	8    @ 40  points = 320
Quizzes
Term Project 
Practice Activity Videos	8    @ 20  points = 160 
1	@200 points = 200
      TBD   points =  70
Midterm Exam	1    @150 points = 150
	
Total 	                        900 points 

Grade                                           Percentage Earned       
A 	               90-100% 
B 	               80-89% 
C 	               70-79% 
D 	               60-69% 
F 	               0-59% 

1.	Participation. You should read the learning material and resources to help gain greater understanding of the topics. Complete all labs and submit your work by the due date. 

2.	Individual work. All work must be turned in on the due date as defined by 11:59 p.m. Late assignments are not allowed at this level, and result in a “100%” loss of the grade assigned unless there is an extension approved by the professor.
